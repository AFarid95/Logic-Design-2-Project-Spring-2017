Project: 8254 Programmable Interval Timer

This project is part of the course "CMPN111 - Logic Design-2" that I took in Cairo University as part of my bachelor's degree in computer engineering.

For details of the implemented functionality, see the 8254 datasheet in "8254.pdf" located in the root directory.
